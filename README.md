## Inference of a gene regulatory network by applying OMOPSO to the S-System and half-system

The problem models are adapted from Khan et. al. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2019.2892450 and Hurtado et. al. doi: 10.1007/s10489-020-01891-1

The optimization algorithm from Hurtado et. al. doi: 10.1007/s10489-020-01891-1

The python implementation of the jMetal framework from Benitez-Hidalgo et. al. is used: doi: 10.1016/j.swevo.2019.100598 - https://github.com/jMetal/jMetalPy

The Gene Expression data is available in the data folder. The SOS DNA Repair data can also be downloaded here: http://wws.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/sites/mcb.UriAlon/files/uploads/DownloadableData/sosdata.zip
